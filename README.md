The website used in this repository is e-commerce sample from [SauceLabs Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/)




## Installation and execution

### Requirements
 - [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - [node 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   - or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple node versions

#### Cloning repository

```text
https://github.com/ltsuda/playwright-study.git
```

#### Installing dependencies
```node
npm install -D
# this will install all necessary development packages to run the tests. See package.json to see all packages installed
```

#### Running the tests
In this repository there are multiple test scripts with different configurations. Please, see the `package.json/scripts` to see all options and to see the Playwright's project, see file `playwright.config.js`

All test scripts will generate the result' files using the Allure Test Reports. Too generate the report, use the following scripts:
```node
npm run allure:generate
```
This will generate ./allure-reports, then run:
```node
npm run allure:open
...
Server started at <http://127.0.1.1:39923/>. Press <Ctrl+C> to exit
```
This will start a webserver with the test reports, just ctrl+click or open the URL that is showing on your terminal


Run the following script to run only the tests using the Chromium browser with 1280x720 viewport
```node
npm run test
```

To run the Visual test cases, run:
```node
npm run test:visual
```
This uses the golden images present at `tests/visual.spec.js-snapshots` directory and compares the pages during the test run

To run E2E sample tests, run:
```node
npm run test:e2e
```

 - [.github/workflows](https://github.com/ltsuda/playwright-study/tree/main/.github/workflows): directory with github workflows that runs at every push to main or every pull request open.
 - [playwright.config.js](https://github.com/ltsuda/playwright-study/blob/main/playwright.config.js): playwright's configuration file to setup things like which reporter library to use, how many test worker to be used, creation of test projects with specific settings. There are four test projects configured, two of them using chromium with 1280x720 and 1920x1080 viewports and two other with chrome and the same view ports. The Firefox and Webkit are commented out as they're making most of the tests to fail, so it needs some throubleshooting before enabling them. See [Playwright Configuration](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration) to know more about the configurations available.
 - [saucedemo/pages](https://github.com/ltsuda/playwright-study/tree/main/saucedemo/pages): directory with all page object and controller files. The components file holds each page/component's selector and functions that returns its [Locator](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator) or [ElementHandle](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-elementhandle). The controller file is the one responsible for interacting with the page elements or manipulate page's data.
 - [saucedemo/pageFixtures.js](https://github.com/ltsuda/playwright-study/blob/main/saucedemo/pages/pageFixtures.js): file with shared functions [Fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures) that extends playwright's `test` to instantiate all page controllers so each test case loads only the controller it needs. There's no overhead using this as Playwright only creates the page controller called in each test.
 - [saucedemo/utils](https://github.com/ltsuda/playwright-study/tree/main/saucedemo/utils): diretory with a file containing all constants used in the tests like all the path URLs, error messages, etc. And the other file with some utilities functions like the one that sets the page's cookie to start some tests already authenticated.
 - [tests](https://github.com/ltsuda/playwright-study/tree/main/tests): directory with all test spec files, including the e2e and visual ones.
 - [tests/visual.spec.js-snapshots](https://github.com/ltsuda/playwright-study/tree/main/tests/visual.spec.js-snapshots): directory with the golden images for the visual test cases using the chromium-hd project.
